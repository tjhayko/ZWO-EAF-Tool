# ZWO EAF Tool

I created this tool to allow people to reset the position (step count) of ZWO EAF Focusers

This software is explicitly without an warranty.
You are using this explicitly at your own risk.

It works on my machine, and in the testing that I've been able to do so far, and I would appreciate if any issues you find are reported,

The SDK API allows this, but ASCOM drivers do not, so I created simple form to provide access to this.

The ASCOM Driver should not be required for this tool to run.

You can download the installer here: https://github.com/tjhayko/ZWO-EAF-Tool/blob/master/ZWO-EAF-Tool-Setup.exe

Please let me know if you have any problems.
